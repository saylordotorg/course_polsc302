need to work through each unit and all its assigned materials.  In order
to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher on the
final exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as you
complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

Time Commitment: This course should take you a total of 96 hoursto
complete.  Each unit includes a time advisory that lists the amount of

your calendar and decide to complete subunit 1.1 (4 hours) on Monday
night, subunit 1.2 (2.5 hours) on Tuesday night, and so forth.
