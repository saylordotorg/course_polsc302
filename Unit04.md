**Unit 4: Anarchism, Marxism, and the Rise of Labor Movements** <span
id="4"></span> 
*This unit examines the revolutionary ideas of anarchism, Marxism, and
labor union-based political movements that took root in the late
19<sup>th</sup> century.  The impact of increased industrialization and
the growing disparity of wealth in both Europe and the U.S. led to
societal and political strife that served as the catalyst for the
writings of Marx, Engels, and anarchists of the era.  The combination of
these problems, coupled with the horrors of World War I, led to the
Russian Revolution and, later, to the rise of Fascism in Europe.*
