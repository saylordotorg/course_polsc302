**Unit 3: Utilitarianism and Civil Disobedience** <span id="3"></span> 
*In this unit, we will examine the philosophy of utilitarianism, or the
belief that governments should undertake actions that maximize benefits
to the greatest number of people.  The primary theorists of early
utilitarianism were the British philosophers Jeremy Bentham and his
student, John Stuart Mill. Henry David Thoreau, a leading figure in
another contemporary movement— transcendentalism—found great inspiration
in utilitarian thought, particularly in its criticism of the morally
compromised nature of society.The writings of Bentham, Mill, and Thoreau
heavily influenced later leaders of civil rights, civil disobedience,
and modern liberation movements, including Dr. Martin Luther King and
Mohandas Gandhi.*

     This writing forms the cornerstone of all Bentham’s philosophical
    thought, which emphasized the pursuit of happiness and freedom. He
    also offered a radical critique of all English institutions: moral,
    religious, educational, political, economic and legal.  Bentham’s
    writings are still at the center of academic debate, especially in
    regards to social policy and welfare economics.

     Instructions: Please read this document. Mill's major contribution
    to utilitarianism is his argument for the qualitative separation of
    pleasures. While Jeremy Bentham treats all forms of happiness as
    equal, Mill argues that intellectual and moral pleasures are
    superior to more physical forms of pleasure. He also distinguishes
    between happiness and contentment, claiming that the former is of
    higher value than the latter. “Utilitarianism”is Mill’s greatest
    work, in which he explains the underlying principles of
    utilitarianism and gives examples for its application in government
    and individual lives.

    part of the lecture examines Jeremy Bentham’s utilitarian logic
    under the name of cost-benefit analysis.  Sandel presents some
    contemporary cases in which cost-benefit analysis was used to put a
    dollar value on human life, giving rise to several objections to
    seeking the greatest good for the greatest number.  In the second
    part, Sandel tests Mill’s pleasure theory by applying it to
    different forms of entertainment.

     Instructions: Please read this document.  Thoreau was not a
    utilitarian, but a key figure in the transcendentalist
    movement—whose core belief was faith in the inherent goodness of man
    and the corruptive nature of society and its institutions on an
    individual’s purity.  Nonetheless, his argument for resistance to
    civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state was
    reflective of utilitarian philosophy. At the time it was written and
    for many years after, Civil Disobedienceinspired leaders throughout
    the world to rise up in a peaceful manner to bring about regime
    change.
