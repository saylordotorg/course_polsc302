**Unit 8: Libertarianism, Neoliberalism, and Neoconservativism** <span
id="8"></span> 
*In this unit, we will study the most prominent political ideologies of
the United States for the past two decades: neo-liberalism,
neo-conservatism, and libertarianism.  As you have no doubt deduced from
earlier readings in the course, the phrases “liberal” and “conservative”
no longer mean what they did during the times of Adam Smith and Edmund
Burke.  Neoliberals tend to advocate for less government control of
social and family issues, but greater government economic and welfare
programs.  Meanwhile, neoconservatives are first and foremost concerned
with national security issues.  They tend to see the developing world,
particularly Islamic-majority countries, as a threat to the very
foundation of America and the world.  Libertarians generally follow a
mix of strident capitalism and utilitarianism.  
  
 In addition to the above ideologies, issues surrounding cultural
diversity have become one of the most active areas of contemporary
political theory and philosophy.  The impact of taking cultural
diversity seriously in modern political societies has led to challenges
to the dominance of liberal theory and to a more serious engagement of
political theory with actual political struggles.*
