**Unit 6: Fascism and Authoritarianism** <span id="6"></span> 
*Fascism is most often associated with the post-World War I regimes of
Germany, Italy, and Spain.  Fascism is typified by a combination of
fierce nationalism and leadership via “the cult of personality” which
together give rise to an authoritarian regime in which persons believed
to be outsiders or threats are victimized through systemic and
institutional means.  In fascist states, the government intertwines
itself throughout the fabric of society, controlling education,
religion, the media, and business in such a manner that there are no
outlets for challenging or seeking relief from the regime.  In more
recent times, fascist leadership has been seen in Southeast Asia,
Central America, and South America.*

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read the synopsis of Mein Kampf.  Written in
    1923 while Hitler was imprisoned for a failed coup, the book
    combines elements of autobiography with an exposition of his
    political ideology.  Mein Kampfwas significant in 1925 because it
    was an open source for the presentation of Hitler's ideas about the
    state of the world. The book is significant in our time because a
    retrospective review of the text reveals the crystallization of
    Hitler's decision to completely exterminate the Jewish presence in
    Europe.  Due to its racist content and the historical effect of
    Nazism upon Europe, it is considered a highly controversial book.
