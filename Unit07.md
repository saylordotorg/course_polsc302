**Unit 7: Rational Choice Theory, Keynesian Policies, and Distributive
Justice** <span id="7"></span> 
*In this unit, we will study additional theories that arose from
post-war and economic depression challenges in America and Western
Europe. During this post-war and Depression-era, three particularly
prominent theories emerged: rational choice, distributive justice, and
Keynesian.  We will learn about all of these, paying particular
attention to the work of John Maynard Keynes and John Rawls, which would
form the basis for modern government welfare and foreign aid
programs. *  
  
 *Keynes was a British economist who promoted some of the more moderate
concepts of socialism, planned economies, and government-sponsored aid
to citizens and businesses.  During the critical post-WWI era, Keynes
argued vehemently that reparations against the Central Powers would lead
to both economic collapse and the rise of nationalistic, authoritarian
governments.  While his warnings were not heeded in the aftermath of
World War I, they were key in the formulation of post-World War II
reconstruction efforts, such as the Marshall Plan.  Keynes also proposed
that government should control the actions of citizens and businesses
through policies of taxation, and that these policies would lead to
greater good for more people than would leaving matters purely to the
free market.*  
  
 *Meanwhile, Rawls, a late 20<sup>th</sup> century political
philosopher, promoted a theory in opposition to utilitarian
principles—that the first duty of the liberal state was to safeguard the
individual's basic civil liberties, and that "the loss of freedom for
some" can never be "made right by a greater good shared by others."  The
primary critics of Keynes and Rawls are Friedrich Hayek and Robert
Nozick, whose works you will also read in this unit.  Nozick and Hayek
advocated classical liberal and utilitarian theories as a solution to
modern day problems—however, in modern-day parlance, these men are
generally considered conservative or libertarian rather than liberal.*

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read this article.  Keynesian economics served
    as the economic model during the later part of the Great Depression,
    World War II, and the post-war economic expansion (1945–1973),
    though it lost some influence following the stagflation of the
    1970s.  The onset of the global financial crisis in 2007 has
    resulted in a resurgence in Keynesian thought.

     Instructions: Please read these two documents.  In the first
    article, Keynes argues against free international trade on the
    grounds that such mobility could endanger peace. In the second
    piece, he presents a brief historical review of laissez-faire
    economic policy.  Though he agrees in principle that the marketplace
    should be free of government interference, he suggests that
    government can play a constructive role in protecting individuals
    from the worst harms of capitalism's cycles, especially as it
    relates to unemployment.  When the Great Depression struck a few
    years later, this work seemed very prescient.

    forestalls such economic ailments as inflation, unemployment,
    recession, or depression.

     Instructions: Please read this article.  Friedman, an economist,
    was the twentieth century’s most prominent advocate of free
    markets.  The argument he presents—the core obligation of business
    is to act in their shareholders' best interests—remains the basis
    for many companies' contention today that "corporate social
    responsibility," serve as a distraction from their primary purpose:
    profit enhancement.
