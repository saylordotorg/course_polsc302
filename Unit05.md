**Unit 5: Communism** <span id="5"></span> 
*In this unit, we will examine the implementation and evolution of
communism in Russia and China.  We will begin with Russia after World
War I, when the nation was suddenly flung into civil war.  Russian
revolutionaries overthrew the Czar, and Russia and other neighboring
states subsequently formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
(USSR).  The USSR installed communist rule under the leadership of
Vladimir Lenin, who was succeeded by Josef Stalin. *  
  
 *Meanwhile, China suffered greatly during the 1930s and 1940s due to
Japanese Occupation, World War II, and civil war.  Under Mao Tse Tung,
the Communist Party of China (CPC) took over China in 1949.  During the
four subsequent decades, China, the USSR, the U.S., and their respective
allies engaged in both an ideological “Cold War” and a series of proxy
“hot” wars in Korea, Vietnam, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. 
The impact of the Soviet losses in Afghanistan and reforms in the USSR’s
political system and economy led to the breakup of the USSR into Russia
and several new states.  Following the death of Mao Tse Tung, Chinese
reformers, led by Deng Xiao Ping, instituted a series of economic and
government reforms that have led to China’s emergence as a global
economic superpower in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.*
