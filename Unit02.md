**Unit 2: 19th Century Conservatism and Social Welfare Theory** <span
id="2"></span> 
*This unit introduces the foundational theories for the conservative and
neo-liberal movements.  Classical theories of conservatism emerged in
response to the revolutions in Europe and the Americas, and the problems
created by urbanization and rapid industrial growth.  As with the
previous unit, the assigned materials explore the government’s duty to
the people, the people’s duty to the government, and the duties of
individuals to one another. *  
  
 *As you will learn in this unit, Burkean and Hobbesian conservative
theory stems from a rather dim view of mankind and the negative impact
that self-interest plays in governance and social order.  This
perception is in contrast to the Classical Liberal and Neo-Liberal views
that contend that self-interest leads to the best outcomes for all.*

    that protection of self-interest could be relied upon as a basis for
    individual decision making, economics, or government.
