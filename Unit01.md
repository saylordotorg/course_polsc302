**Unit 1: The Social Contract, Capitalism, and the Roots of Liberal
Political Theory** <span id="1"></span> 
*This unit will introduce the foundational theories for modern democracy
and free markets in modern Western Civilization.  Classical liberal
theories are rooted in individual liberty, limited powers of
government, and, to a lesser extent, capitalism.  We will explore the
respective duties of the government to its people, of the people to
their government, and of individuals to one another.  Many of the
theories we will study in this unit (including those of Montesquieu,
Locke, and Rousseau) inspired much of the rhetoric in the US Declaration
of Independence and Constitution, and played a major part in the
revolutions that overthrew monarchies in Europe during the
18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> Centuries.  Note: as you will see in
this unit and the next, the terms “Liberal” and “Conservative” have
different meanings today than they did at the time of their origin.*

    classical liberalism.  It will give you a broad overview of the
    issues of governance that classical liberals felt were the most
    compelling.  It is important to keep in mind that the NCPA is a
    self-described “conservative” think tank; hence, the author’s
    opinions could be considered ideologically bent, especially as he
    argues President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s classical liberal concept
    of “rights.” This being said, you should think critically about the
    content of the article and consider alternative points of view.

    with this treatise was to determine whether there can be

    were not divinely empowered to legislate and that political
    legitimacy comes only from a social contract agreed upon by all
    citizens for their mutual preservation—helped to inspire political
    reforms and revolutions throughout Europe.
